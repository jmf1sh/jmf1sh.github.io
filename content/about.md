My name is Jonathan. After completing a PhD in pure mathematics at the
[University of Toronto](https://www.math.toronto.edu/cms/) I took a research postdoc
position in [GRK 1670](http://grk1670.math.uni-hamburg.de/) at
[Universität Hambug](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/). Then I decided to do
something a little bit more applied, so I took a postdoc position in scientific
computing at the
[Jülich Center for Neutron Science](http://www.fz-juelich.de/jcns/EN/Home/home_node.html).
Currently, I do machine learning-related things at
[Cape Analytics](https://capeanalytics.com/).
My primary interests are applied mathematics and high-performance computing.
