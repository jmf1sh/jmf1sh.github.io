This post has been migrated from my old blog, the
[math-physics learning seminar](https://mathphysseminar.blogspot.com/).

I was thinking about how to put this blog to use, and especially how to make it
worthwhile for myself. In 2010, I ran a learning seminar on math/physics which
in my opinion was extremely successful. I made detailed notes for nearly all of
the talks, and I had several people ask me at the end of the seminar to give
them copies of the notes I had made. We managed to do something very special in
the seminar, and I think it's worth writing up notes from the best talks (and
reorganizing/elaborating/etc. when necessary) and putting them online for all to
see. It gives me a chance to practice my math writing, and if I ever run another
seminar of this flavor (or teach a course, or write a book...) then a lot of the
work will already be done for me.

Here is a rough outline of the topics we covered (or that need to be covered as
background):

As you can see, it was an ambitious seminar! I will update the outline as I go
through my old notes and start posting them.
