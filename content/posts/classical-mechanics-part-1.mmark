This post has been migrated from my old blog, the [math-physics learning seminar](https://mathphysseminar.blogspot.com/).


This is a surpisingly hard topic, and someday I would like to make an honest attempt at it. But Feynman did it better than I ever could! See "What is a Force?" from the Feynman Lectures on Physics, available here: here [pdf](http://strangebeautiful.com/other-texts/feynman-phys-lects-1_12.pdf).


I promise to update eventually.
