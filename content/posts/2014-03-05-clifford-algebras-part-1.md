 Clifford Algebras
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today I'd like to write some brief notes about Clifford algebras and spinors. A
classic reference is the paper "Clifford Modules" by Atiyah-Bott-Shapiro.
Clifford algebras not only useful in algebra and geometry, but are essential for
the construction of theories with fermions. Let \\(V\\) be a vector space with a
non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form \\(B\\). We define the Clifford algebra
\\(Cl(V, B)\\) to be the unital associative algebra generated by \\(v \in V\\) subject
to the relation

\\[ vw + wv = -2B(v,w) \\]

Equivalently, the definiting relation is \\(v^2 = -B(v,v)\\).


The Clifford algebra inherits a \\(\mathbb Z\\)-filtration as well as a
\\(\mathbb Z_2\\)-grading from the tensor algebra. In fact, we have an analogue
of the Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt theorem for Lie algebras:


Theorem The associated graded algebra of \\(Cl(V,B)\\) is naturally isomorphic to
the exterior algebra on \\(V\\).


In this way, we may view the Clifford algebra as a quantization of the
exterior algebra, much in the same way that \\(U(\mathfrak g)\\) is a
quantization of the Poisson algebra of functions on
\\(\mathfrak g^\ast\\) for a Lie algebra \\(\mathfrak g\\).


Example. Take (V,B) to be the Euclidean space \\(\mathbb E^1\\). Then we have a
single generator \\(e\\) satisfying the relation \\(e^2 =  -1\\). Hence

\\[ Cl(\mathbb R) \cong \mathbb R \cdot 1 \oplus \mathbb R \cdot e \cong \mathbb C \\]

Where the isomorpism is given by \\(e \mapsto i = \sqrt{-1}\\).


Example. Take \\(\mathbb E^2\\). We have generators \\(e_1, e_2\\) both squaring to -1,
and additionally we have \\(e_1 e_2 = e_2 e_1\\). We can define an isomorphism from
\\(Cl(\mathbb E^2)\\) to the quaternions \\(\mathbb H\\) by
\\(e_1 \mapsto i, e_2 \mapsto j\\).


Spinors
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now consider the complexified Clifford algebra, denoted \\(\mathbb{C}l(V)\\). Since
we can now take square roots of negative numbers, the complex Clifford algebra
is insensitive to the signature (as long as our bilinear form is
non-degenerate). Denote by \\(C_n\\) the complex Clifford algebra \\(Cl(\mathbb C^n)\\),
where \\(\mathbb C^n\\) is equipped with the standard bilinear form
\\((x,y) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i\\).


Definition. A subspace \\(W \subset \mathbb C^n\\) is isotropic if the restriction
of the standard bilinear form to \\(W\\) is identically 0. A maximal isotropic
subspace is an isotropic subspace that is not properly contained in any other
isotropic subspace.


Theorem. Let \\(W\\) be a maximal isotropic subspace, and let\\( \{w_1, \dots, w_k\}\\)
be a basis of \\(W\\). Let \\(\omega = w_1 \cdots w_k \in C_n\\), and let
\\(S = C_n \cdot \omega\\). If n is even, then \\(S\\) is an irreducible Clifford
module. If n is odd, then \\(S=S^+ \oplus S^-\\) is a direct sum irreducible
Clifford modules, and \\(S^+ \cong S^-\\).

Irreducible Clifford modules are called spinor modules. This description of
spinor modules allows one to prove straightforwardly the following complete
classification of complex Clifford algebras.


Corollary. We have \\(C_{2m} \cong \mathrm{End}(\mathbb C^m)\\) and
\\(C_{2m+1} \cong \mathrm{End}(\mathbb C^m) \oplus \mathrm{End}(\mathbb C^m)\\).


Note that this classification depends on n mod 2, which is closely related to
Bott periodicity. There is a similar classification of real Clifford algebras.


Dirac Operators
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now we come to the real importance of Clifford algebras. Consider Euclidean
space \\(\mathbb{E}^n\\) and let \\(S\\) be a spinor module for its Clifford algebra.
We define the Dirac operator acting on \\(S\\)-valued functions as

\\[ D f = \sum_{i=1}^n e_i \cdot \partial_i f \\]

Now the amazing property of \\(D\\) is the following:

\\[ D^2 = \sum_{i,j} e_i e_j \partial_i \partial_j = \sum_i e_i^2 \partial_i^2 + \sum_{i,j} e_i e_j [\partial_i, \partial_j] = -\Delta \\]

hence the Dirac operator provides an algebraic (as opposed to
pseudodifferential) square root of the Laplacian.
