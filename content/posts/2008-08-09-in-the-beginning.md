This post has been migrated from my old blog, the [math-physics learning seminar](https://mathphysseminar.blogspot.com/).


Well this is the first post. I'm on the tail end of a MSc right now, and set to start my PhD in the fall, so I thought it might be interesting to document my (probable) descent into madness. I had thought about doing this at the beginning of my MSc, but I guess I never got around to it. Much of this blog will focus on my own studies/progress, as well as happenings at my university, but I don't plan on trying too hard to keep it strictly academic. We'll see how it goes.
