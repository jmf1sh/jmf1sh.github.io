This post has been migrated from my old blog, the [math-physics learning seminar](https://mathphysseminar.blogspot.com/).


I found some lectures by Sara Pasquetti on Seiberg-Witten theory here:


[Lecture 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvNRbdlp-Sg)
[Lecture 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz61-ryl_Ck)
[Lecture 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AWOrAYkCTU)
     

Unfortunately, it seems that the quality is so poor that it is impossible to read the blackboard!
