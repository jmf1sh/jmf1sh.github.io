[Lectures on String Theory by Susskind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25haxRuZQUk&feature=list_related&playnext=1&list=SPA2FDCCBC7956448F)


This is a series of introductory lectures on string theory by cofounder Leonard Susskind. Regardless of whether you think string theory has anything to say about the universe we live it, it's very cool to hear about its origins from one of the people who dreamt it up.
