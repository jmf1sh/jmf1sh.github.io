jonathan's blog
----------------

This is the raw source for my blog, currently hosted
[here on github pages](https://jmf1sh.github.io).
Content from around 2017 and earlier has been migrated from my old blog, the
[math-physics learning seminar](http://mathphysseminar.blogspot.com/), which is
no longer being maintained. The old blog served as notes for a seminar that I
was running as a graduate student at the
[Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.toronto.edu) at the University of
Toronto and later while I was a postdoc in
[GRK 1670](https://grk1670.math.uni-hamburg.de/) at Universit√§t Hamburg.

The site is intended to be generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). We use git
submodules for the Hugo theme
[kiera](https://github.com/funkydan2/hugo-kiera), so clone the repository via
`git clone --recursive`. The repository contains two branches
* `master` the (mostly plain-text) content and themes
* `generated` the Hugo-generated content, not intended to be read or modified by
  hand

The script `hugo-serve.sh` is provided for convenience while editing new posts.
Content can be generated by simply running `hugo` from the root directory. For
convenience, make the subdirectory `public` point to the `generated` branch via
`git worktree`:
```
git checkout master
git worktree add -B generated public origin/generated
```

You can find a list of ideas/topics for potential posts [here](TODO.md).
