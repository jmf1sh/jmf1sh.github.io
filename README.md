jonathan's blog
----------------

This is the raw source for my blog, hosted on github pages. The site is intended
to be generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). We use git submodules (mainly
for the Hugo theme [kiera](https://github.com/funkydan2/hugo-kiera)), so clone the
repository via `git clone --recursive`. The repository contains two branches
* `master` the (mostly plain-text) content and themes
* `generated` the Hugo-generated content, not intended to be read or modified by
  hand

The script `hugo-serve.sh` is provided for convenience while editing new posts.
Content can be generated by simply running `hugo` from the root directory. For
convenience, make the subdirectory `public` point to the `generated` branch via
`git worktree`:
```
git checkout master
git worktree add -B generated public origin/generated
```

Most of the older content has been migrated from my old blog, the
[math-physics learning seminar](http://mathphysseminar.blogspot.com/). The old
blog is no longer being maintained.
