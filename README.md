----------------

This is the raw source for my blog, hosted on github pages. The site is intended to be generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). We use git submodules (mainly for the Hugo theme [kiera](https://github.com/avianto/hugo-kiera)), so clone the repository via `git clone --recursive`. The repository contains two branches
* `hugo` the (mostly plain-text) content and themes
* `master` the Hugo-generated content, not intended to be read or modified by hand
The script `hugo-serve.sh` is provided for convenience while editing new posts. Content can be generated by simply running `hugo` from the root directory. For convenience, make the subdirectory `public` point to the `master` branch via `git worktree`:
```
git checkout hugo
git worktree add -B master public upstream/master
```

Most of the older content has been migrated from my old blog, the [math-physics learning seminar](http://mathphysseminar.blogspot.com/). The old blog is no longer being maintained.
