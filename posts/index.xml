      <description>I want to record here a very interesting thing which I recently discovered, variance-stabilizing transformations. The idea is very simple: suppose we have a random variable \(x\), which follows a probability distribution which is parametrized solely by its mean \(\mu\), with variance \(var(x) = g(\mu)\) a known function of the mean.</description>

Recently, I&#39;ve been learning some topics related to machine learning, and especially manifold learning. These both fall under the general notion of inverse problems: given some mathematical object $X$ (it could be a function $f: A \to B$, or a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$, or a probability measure $d\mu$ on a space $X$, etc.</description>

Finally, I want to discuss gauge-invariant of the gauge-fixed theory. (!?) We saw in the previous posts that if we have a gauge theory with connection (A) and matter fields (\psi), in order to derive sensible Feynman rules we have to introduce a gauge-fixing function (G) as well as Fermionic fields (c, \bar{c}), the ghosts.</description>

Consider the heat equation
[ \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = -\hat{H} \psi ]
We find similarly
[ \langle x_N|U_t|x0\rangle = \int \exp \sum^{N-1} ik_j(xj - x{j+1}) -\Delta t H(x_j, k_j) dx dk.</description>

In my previous posts on path integrals, I described (rather tersely) how the path integral, suitably defined and interpreted, can be used to compute the Schwartz kernel of the operators (e^{iHt}) (Lorentzian signature) and (e^{-Ht}) (Euclidean signature).</description>

Last time we saw that a classical mechanical system which has a Lagrangian formulation can (under some mild assumptions) be repackaged as a symplectic manifold ((M, \omega)) together with a smooth function (H) called the Hamiltonian.</description>

As we saw in the previous post, the equations of motion for a mechanical system can be cast into a 1st order form called Hamilton&#39;s equations, which are naturally interpreted as describing a path in the phase space (T^\ast M) associated to the configuration space (M).</description>
